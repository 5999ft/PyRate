#Testing the run_prepifg.py with new dataset both in Pycharm and rhe_compute.
#For Pycharm the datset (one interferogram) was processed locally.
#For both test cases the option for Parallel=1 was selected.
#For one image as a test in Pycharm(Windows), it took 25 minutes to complete the task with run_prepifg.py program. 
#Test on rhe_compute repeated again with "parallel = 0" and "Luigi = 1". The progress is faster than "parallel= 1 or 2 " but still low in spead. .
