Welcome to PyRate's documentation!
==================================
PyRate is a collection of Python 2 scripts for estimating the average rate (velocity) and incremental time-series of surface movement for every pixel in a stack of images generated by interferometric processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. PyRate is a partial Python translation of [Ï€-RATE](http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earhw/software/pirate/), a MATLAB tool developed at the University of Leeds.
